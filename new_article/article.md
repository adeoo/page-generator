# My-First-Blog-Post
This is my first blog post using my brand new "static site generator". it is basically a script that generates webpages with a predetermined template, in my case the template consists of the nav bar, the black background and more. the end result is an easy workflow to produce blog posts. now, i dont have to write the whole html code for each post i make, then update my blog page to include my most recent post link. instead i can just write whatever in a markdown file and run the script which takes care of the rest.

i am satisfied with my little project, thats why ill be sharing it on my github. also ill leave a pic of a cute cat.
